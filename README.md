#Finding Midpoints of City Data Street Segments

For every street surveyed in the summer of 2015, I used http://www.geomidpoint.com/ to locate the midpoint. Within the dataset located in Google drive, the street segment: Granville/Keystone --> Dead end was not included because the location could not be found. Also, the street segment: Rosehill/Paulina --> Rosehill/Ashland was duplicated which I then deleted one.
